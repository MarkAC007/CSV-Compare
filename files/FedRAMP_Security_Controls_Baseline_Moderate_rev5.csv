CM-6 (a) Requirement 2: The service provider shall ensure that checklists for configuration settings are Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) validated or SCAP compatible (if validated checklists are not available).

CM-6 Guidance: Compliance checks are used to evaluate configuration settings and provide general insight into the overall effectiveness of configuration management activities. CSPs and 3PAOs typically combine compliance check findings into a single CM-6 finding, which is acceptable. However, for initial assessments, annual assessments, and significant change requests, FedRAMP requires a clear understanding, on a per-control basis, where risks exist. Therefore, 3PAOs must also analyze compliance check findings as part of the controls assessment. Where a direct mapping exists, the 3PAO must document additional findings per control in the corresponding SAR Risk Exposure Table (RET), which are then documented in the CSP’s Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M). This will likely result in the details of individual control findings overlapping with those in the combined CM-6 finding, which is acceptable.
During monthly continuous monitoring, new findings from CSP compliance checks may be combined into a single CM-6 POA&M item. CSPs are not required to map the findings to specific controls because controls are only assessed during initial assessments, annual assessments, and significant change requests.",

RA-5 Guidance: Informational findings from a scanner are detailed as a returned result that holds no vulnerability risk or severity and for FedRAMP does not require an entry onto the POA&M or entry onto the RET during any assessment phase.
Warning findings, on the other hand, are given a risk rating (low, moderate, high or critical) by the scanning solution and should be treated like any other finding with a risk or severity rating for tracking purposes onto either the POA&M or RET depending on when the findings originated (during assessments or during monthly continuous monitoring). If a warning is received during scanning, but further validation turns up no actual issue then this item should be categorized as a false positive. If this situation presents itself during an assessment phase (initial assessment, annual assessment or any SCR), follow guidance on how to report false positives in the Security Assessment Report (SAR). If this situation happens during monthly continuous monitoring, a deviation request will need to be submitted per the FedRAMP Vulnerability Deviation Request Form.
Warnings are commonly associated with scanning solutions that also perform compliance scans, and if the scanner reports a “warning” as part of the compliance scanning of a CSO, follow guidance surrounding the tracking of compliance findings during either the assessment phases (initial assessment, annual assessment or any SCR) or monthly continuous monitoring as it applies. Guidance on compliance scan findings can be found by searching on “Tracking of Compliance Scans” in FAQs.

For clarity, this control applies to all data in transit. Examples include the following data flows:
 - Crossing the system boundary
 - Between compute instances - including containers
 - From a compute instance to storage
 - Replication between availability zones
 - Transmission of backups to storage
 - From a load balancer to a compute instance
 - Flows from management tools required for their work – e.g. log collection, scanning, etc.

SC-8 Guidance:
SC-8 (5) applies when physical protection has been selected as the method to protect confidentiality and integrity. For physical protection, data in transit must be in either a Controlled Access Area (CAA), or a Hardened or alarmed PDS.

Hardened or alarmed PDS: Shall be as defined in SECTION X - CATEGORY 2 PDS INSTALLATION GUIDANCE of CNSSI No.7003, titled PROTECTED DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS (PDS). Per the CNSSI No. 7003 Section VIII, PDS must originate and terminate in a Controlled Access Area (CAA). 

Controlled Access Area (CAA): Data will be considered physically protected, and in a CAA if it meets Section 2.3 of the DHS’s Recommended Practice: Improving Industrial Control System Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. CSPs can meet Section 2.3 of the DHS’ recommended practice by satisfactory implementation of the following controls PE-2 (1), PE-2 (2), PE-2 (3), PE-3 (2), PE-3 (3), PE-6 (2), and PE-6 (3).
